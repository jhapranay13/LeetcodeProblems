/**
 *
 * A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point (0, 0) facing north. The robot can receive a sequence of these three possible types of commands:
 *
 * -2: Turn left 90 degrees.
 * -1: Turn right 90 degrees.
 * 1 <= k <= 9: Move forward k units, one unit at a time.
 * Some of the grid squares are obstacles. The ith obstacle is at grid point obstacles[i] = (xi, yi). If the robot runs into an obstacle, then it will instead stay in its current location and move on to the next command.
 *
 * Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot ever gets from the origin squared (i.e. if the distance is 5, return 25).
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * North means +Y direction.
 * East means +X direction.
 * South means -Y direction.
 * West means -X direction.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []
 * Output: 25
 * Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
 * 1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
 * 2. Turn right.
 * 3. Move east 3 units to (3, 4).
 * The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (3, 4), which squared is 32 + 42 = 25 units away.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]
 * Output: 65
 * Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
 * 1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
 * 2. Turn right.
 * 3. Move east 1 unit and get blocked by the obstacle at (2, 4), robot is at (1, 4).
 * 4. Turn left.
 * 5. Move north 4 units to (1, 8).
 * The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (1, 8), which squared is 12 + 82 = 65 units away.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: commands = [6,-1,-1,6], obstacles = []
 * Output: 36
 * Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
 * 1. Move north 6 units to (0, 6).
 * 2. Turn right.
 * 3. Turn right.
 * 4. Move south 6 units to (0, 0).
 * The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (0, 6), which squared is 62 = 36 units away.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= commands.length <= 10^4
 * commands[i] is either -2, -1, or an integer in the range [1, 9].
 * 0 <= obstacles.length <= 10^4
 * -3 * 10^4 <= xi, yi <= 3 * 10^4
 * The answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.
