/*
Given an array arr and a function fn, return a sorted array sortedArr. You can assume fn only returns numbers and those numbers determine the sort order of sortedArr. sortedArray must be sorted in ascending order by fn output.

You may assume that fn will never duplicate numbers for a given array.



Example 1:

Input: arr = [5, 4, 1, 2, 3], fn = (x) => x
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: fn simply returns the number passed to it so the array is sorted in ascending order.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [{"x": 1}, {"x": 0}, {"x": -1}], fn = (d) => d.x
Output: [{"x": -1}, {"x": 0}, {"x": 1}]
Explanation: fn returns the value for the "x" key. So the array is sorted based on that value.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [[3, 4], [5, 2], [10, 1]], fn = (x) => x[1]
Output: [[10, 1], [5, 2], [3, 4]]
Explanation: arr is sorted in ascending order by number at index=1.


Constraints:

arr is a valid JSON array
fn is a function that returns a number
1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 105

Overview
In this problem, you are asked to create a JavaScript function named sortBy, which will sort an array arr according to a function fn provided as input. The function fn always returns a number, and this number is used to determine the sort order of arr. The result should be an array sortedArr, sorted in ascending order according to the output of function fn.

The problem description provides three key examples to clarify the expected functionality. The first example passes an array of numbers and a function that simply returns its input as it is, resulting in an array sorted in ascending order. The second example uses an array of objects and a function that returns the value of a specific key, "x" in this case, within each object. The output is an array of objects sorted according to the values of "x". The third example contains an array of arrays, with a function that returns the second element of each array (index = 1). The output array is sorted in ascending order based on these second elements.

Solving this problem effectively requires a good understanding of JavaScript's Array.sort() method, callback functions, and array manipulations. You should be able to define and use callback functions to extract the value needed for sorting from the array elements. A thorough knowledge of how JavaScript handles sorting of different data types (numbers, objects, arrays) will also be beneficial.

For a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript's Array.sort() function and sorting in JavaScript in general, we recommend checking out the Array.prototype.sort() guide on MDN. If you're new to callback functions in JavaScript, you may also find our Create Hello World Function editorial helpful.

Understanding Array.sort() in JavaScript
JavaScript's built-in Array.sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place. It is important to note that the sort operation directly modifies (mutates) the original array, rather than creating a new sorted array. This is different from some array methods like Array.map(), which create a new array based on the original. In JavaScript, functions that modify the original array or object are called "mutating" or "in-place" operations.

What does it mean when we say that Array.sort() "returns" the sorted array? After Array.sort() has sorted the original array, it gives back a reference to the same (now sorted) array. This is not a 'return' in the sense of creating a new array with the sorted elements, but rather a convenience feature to allow method chaining.

The sort() method, by default, converts elements into strings and compares their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values to determine the sort order. This works for strings but can lead to unexpected results when sorting numbers or mixed data types.

For instance, the array [10, 2, 20] would be sorted as [10, 2, 20] when sorted with Array.sort() because when converted to strings, "10" comes before "2" in lexicographic order. This is one of the reasons why a compare function is often supplied to the sort() method when working with numeric data.

Here's a basic usage of the Array.sort() method:

let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange"]
In the above example, the sort() method arranges the fruit names alphabetically. Note that the original fruits array is sorted in place - no new array is created.

It's important to note that the Array.sort() method does not guarantee a stable sort. Stability in sorting algorithms is the property where equal elements retain their relative order in the sorted output as in the original array. The stability of the Array.sort() function depends on the specific implementation of the JavaScript engine. Some implementations of JavaScript may provide stability, while others may not.

For example, if you're sorting an array of students by grade and two students have the same grade, a stable sort will preserve the original order of those two students. However, if the JavaScript engine's Array.sort() method is not stable, this original order may not be preserved.

Examples of stable sort algorithms include Merge Sort and TimSort (used by Python and Java, and also in V8 for arrays longer than 10 elements). On the contrary, QuickSort and HeapSort are examples of unstable sorting algorithms.

Thus, when it is important to maintain the relative order of equal elements in your sorted output, you should consider using or implementing a stable sorting algorithm, rather than relying on the built-in Array.sort() method.

Custom Sorting with Compare Function
While Array.sort() without a compare function can suffice for arrays of strings, it often doesn't work as expected for arrays of numbers or when there is a specific sorting criteria for arrays of objects. This is where the compare function comes in.

Array.sort() allows us to pass a compare function to customize the sorting mechanism. The compare function should be a function that takes two arguments and returns a negative, zero, or positive value:

Negative Value: If the compare function returns a value less than zero, it sorts a to an index lower than b. In simple terms, a should come before b.

Positive Value: If the compare function returns a value greater than zero, it sorts a to an index higher than b. That is, a should come after b.

Zero: If the compare function returns 0, it leaves a and b unchanged with respect to each other. However, their order compared to other elements is sorted.

Here's how you can sort numbers in ascending order by using a compare function:

let numbers = [40, 1, 5, 200];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 5, 40, 200]
In the above example, the compare function is (a, b) => a - b. This function subtracts b from a. If a is less than b, a negative value is returned, placing a before b. If a is more than b, a positive value is returned, placing a after b. If a equals b, zero is returned, leaving their relative positions unchanged.

This is a powerful tool in JavaScript, as it allows us to sort complex data structures easily. For example, you could sort an array of objects based on one of their properties, sort strings with locale considerations, or even implement multi-criteria sorting.

For instance, consider sorting an array of objects based on the age property in descending order:

let people = [
  { name: "John", age: 23 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 17 },
  { name: "Zack", age: 30 },
];
people.sort((a, b) => b.age - a.age);
console.log(people);
// [
//   { name: "Zack", age: 30 },
//   { name: "John", age: 23 },
//   { name: "Amy", age: 17 }
// ]
In this case, b.age - a.age sorts the people array in descending order of age.

Working with Callback Functions in JavaScript
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument into another function. This passed function is then invoked at a later time or in response to some event within the containing function. The use of callback functions is a fundamental concept in JavaScript due to its asynchronous nature, which requires a way to manage operations that don't finish immediately (like network requests or timers).

In our sortBy function, a callback function fn is passed as an argument. This fn function is then used inside the Array.sort() method's compare function to determine the sort order of elements in the array.

Let's take a look at a simple example of using a callback function:

function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log('Hello ' + name);
    callback();
}

// usage
greet('John', function() {
    console.log('The callback was invoked!');
});

// Hello John
// The callback was invoked!
In this example, the second argument of the greet function is a callback function. After the 'Hello John' message is logged, the greet function invokes the callback function that was passed in. This pattern of passing functions as arguments for later execution is very common in JavaScript and is used in various aspects of the language, from handling events to processing asynchronous operations.

Real World Applications of Array.sort() with Custom Comparators
Displaying Sorted Data on a UI
One of the prevalent applications of Array.sort() is displaying sorted data on a user interface. Consider a product listing page where items can be sorted by name, price, or date.

let products = [
  { name: 'Apple', price: 1 },
  { name: 'Banana', price: 0.5 },
  { name: 'Cherry', price: 2 }
];

products.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
console.log(products); // [{ name: 'Apple', price: 1 }, { name: 'Banana', price: 0.5 }, { name: 'Cherry', price: 2 }]
This example demonstrates how Array.sort() with a custom comparator is used to alphabetically sort an array of product objects by their names. The localeCompare() method is a powerful tool for comparing strings in JavaScript, taking into account locale specific rules of string comparison. For instance, in Swedish, "Ã¤" is considered a separate letter that sorts after "z". A naive comparison would fail to take this into account.

By using localeCompare(), you ensure that your code is fully internationalizable and can handle a wide array of human languages correctly. This would be critically important in an e-commerce application that lists products and needs to support internationalization.

Data Analysis and Insights
Array.sort() is often utilized in data analysis. If you're working with numerical data, sorting can be a crucial first step in understanding the dataset, for instance, in finding the median value or recognizing the distribution.

let numbers = [42, 21, 1, 100, 75, 3];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers); // [1, 3, 21, 42, 75, 100]
Here, Array.sort() is used to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

Prioritizing Task Execution
In scenarios where data needs to be processed in a specific order, Array.sort() comes in handy. An example can be processing tasks based on their priority levels.

let tasks = [
  { title: 'Task 1', priority: 'Low' },
  { title: 'Task 2', priority: 'High' },
  { title: 'Task 3', priority: 'Medium' }
];

let priorityOrder = { 'Low': 1, 'Medium': 2, 'High': 3 };

tasks.sort((a, b) => priorityOrder[a.priority] - priorityOrder[b.priority]);
console.log(tasks); // [{ title: 'Task 1', priority: 'Low' }, { title: 'Task 3', priority: 'Medium' }, { title: 'Task 2', priority: 'High' }]
In this scenario, Array.sort() is used to sort an array of tasks based on their defined priorities.

Sorting Objects on Deep Properties
let arr = [
  { prop: { deep: 3 } },
  { prop: { deep: 1 } },
  { prop: { deep: 2 } }
];

arr.sort((a, b) => a.prop.deep - b.prop.deep);
console.log(arr); // [{ prop: { deep: 1 } }, { prop: { deep: 2 } }, { prop: { deep: 3 } }]
In this example, Array.sort() sorts an array of objects based on a nested property.
