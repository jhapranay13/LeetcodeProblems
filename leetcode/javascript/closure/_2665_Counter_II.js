/*
Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.

toBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values === each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error "Not Equal".
notToBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values !== each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error "Equal".


Example 1:

Input: func = () => expect(5).toBe(5)
Output: {"value": true}
Explanation: 5 === 5 so this expression returns true.
Example 2:

Input: func = () => expect(5).toBe(null)
Output: {"error": "Not Equal"}
Explanation: 5 !== null so this expression throw the error "Not Equal".
Example 3:

Input: func = () => expect(5).notToBe(null)
Output: {"value": true}
Explanation: 5 !== null so this expression returns true.

Overview
This problem requires you to create a JavaScript function called expect that aids developers in testing their code. The function expect takes any value as its argument and returns an object consisting of two methods: toBe(val) and notToBe(val).

The toBe(val) method accepts another value and returns true if the two values are strictly equal (===), but throws an error stating "Not Equal" if they are not. Conversely, the notToBe(val) method accepts another value and returns true if the two values are not strictly equal (!==), but throws an error stating "Equal" if they are.

To effectively tackle this problem, a strong grasp of JavaScript concepts such as objects, functions, and the strict equality and inequality operators (=== and !==) is crucial. Additionally, it's vital to understand JavaScript's error handling mechanisms, especially the throw statement. The expect function is widely used in various testing frameworks to ascertain that specific code segments behave as intended. It can help verify that a particular function yields the correct value for a given input, or that an object's state alters as predicted when a specific method is invoked. To enhance your understanding, we recommend reviewing resources on JavaScript's Strict Equality and Strict Inequality operators, as well as the throw statement.

JavaScript Objects and Function Returns
In JavaScript, functions can return objects, which are collections of related data and functions, often known as properties and methods.

Here's an example of a function that returns an object:

function createPerson(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    greet: function() {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
  };
}

let person = createPerson("Alice", 25);
person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 25 years old."
A fundamental concept in JavaScript, particularly when dealing with objects, is the use of the this keyword. For a deep dive into this crucial aspect of JavaScript, we highly recommend our Array Prototype Last editorial.

JavaScript Objects and Limited Method Chaining
JavaScript objects serve as vital constructs that group related data and functions together. They can hold various data types, including functions, which are considered methods of the object when they reside within it.

In the problem at hand, the expect function returns an object. This object includes the toBe and notToBe methods. Although these methods can be invoked sequentially in a chain-like manner, this represents a restricted form of method chaining as they do not return the original object for further chaining, which is a key characteristic of method chaining in JavaScript programming.

Full method chaining is a common pattern in JavaScript that permits multiple methods to be invoked in a single statement. This pattern is implemented when each method returns an object, which could be the original object (for mutable objects) or a new object (for immutable objects). Full method chaining enhances readability and conciseness of the code and is a preferred pattern in many JavaScript libraries.

Here's an example of full method chaining:

let arr = [5, 2, 8, 1];

let result = arr.sort().reverse().join("-");

console.log(result); // "8-5-2-1"
In this example, the sort() method sorts the array, the reverse() method subsequently reverses the sorted array, and finally, the join("-") method joins the elements into a string with "-" as a separator. Each of these methods returns an array, allowing the next method to be directly invoked on the result.

Within the context of the expect function, a restricted form of method chaining enables developers to seamlessly use the toBe and notToBe methods in a single line, as shown below:

expect(5).toBe(5); // Returns true or throws an error
expect(5).notToBe(3); // Returns true or throws an error
The expect function returns an object containing the toBe and notToBe methods. These methods do not return the original object; instead, they either return true or throw an error. As such, the expect function provides a limited form of method chaining which, nonetheless, proves useful in numerous scenarios.

JavaScript Error Handling
Error handling in JavaScript is primarily accomplished through the use of throw statements and try...catch blocks. The throw statement allows you to create custom error messages, which can be very useful for debugging your code. There are different ways to use the throw statement based on what you want to achieve.

Throwing a string:
You can throw a string in JavaScript. It will be caught as an error message in the catch block.

function checkName(name) {
  if (name === '') {
    throw "Name can't be empty!";
  }
  return name;
}

try {
  console.log(checkName(''));
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // "Name can't be empty!"
}
Throwing an Error instance:
A more common and recommended approach is to throw an Error instance. This allows additional metadata like a stack trace to be included with the error, aiding in debugging.

function divide(numerator, denominator) {
  if (denominator === 0) {
    throw new Error("Cannot divide by zero!");
  }
  return numerator / denominator;
}

try {
  console.log(divide(5, 0));
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message); // "Cannot divide by zero!"
}
Throwing an Aggregated Error:
There are times when you might want to throw multiple errors at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with Promises. JavaScript has an in-built AggregateError object that can be used in these scenarios. The AggregateError object takes an iterable of error objects and an optional message as parameters.

let error1 = new Error("First Error");
let error2 = new Error("Second Error");

try {
  throw new AggregateError([error1, error2], "Two errors occurred.");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof AggregateError) {
    console.error(error.message); // "Two errors occurred."
    for (let e of error.errors) {
      console.error(e.message); // logs "First Error" then "Second Error"
    }
  }
}
Approach 1: Object Factory
Intuition
In this problem, we are asked to implement a function called expect that is used to perform some basic tests on code. The function should take in any value and return an object with two methods: toBe and notToBe.

The toBe method should take in another value and return true if the two values are strictly equal to each other (===). If they are not equal, it should throw an error with the message "Not Equal".

Similarly, the notToBe method should take in another value and return true if the two values are not strictly equal to each other (!==). If they are equal, it should throw an error with the message "Equal".

Algorithm
Return an object from expect that contains the methods toBe and notToBe.
In the toBe method, compare the input value with the value passed into expect. If they are equal, return true. If not, throw an error with the message "Not Equal".
Similarly, in the notToBe method, compare the input value with the value passed into expect. If they are not equal, return true. If they are, throw an error with the message "Equal".
Implementation
This solution can be realized either through the given function expression or by constructing an additional ES6 class.

Implementation 1: Function expression

In this implementation, the expect function acts as a factory function, creating an object with two methods: toBe and notToBe. Each of these methods uses the strict equality (===) or inequality (!==) operator to compare val with the value passed in, returning true or throwing an error based on the comparison's outcome.

Implementation 2: Using ES6 Classes

In this code, expect is a function that returns a new instance of the Expect class. This instance retains the value passed into expect and uses it for its toBe and notToBe methods.

Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1), the function only creates an object with two methods and does not perform any iterative or recursive operations.

Space complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1), the function always creates an object with exactly two methods, regardless of the size or complexity of the input value. Therefore, the amount of memory required by the function does not scale with the input size, resulting in constant space complexity.

Interview Tips:
What does it mean when functions return objects or other functions in JavaScript?

When a function returns an object or another function, it's making use of higher-order functions and factory functions. Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. Factory functions, on the other hand, are functions that return object instances. This concept is crucial in functional programming and provides a way to encapsulate and reuse code.
How does method chaining work in JavaScript, and when would it be beneficial to use?

Method chaining is a common pattern in JavaScript where multiple methods are called in a single statement. This is possible when each method returns an object, which may be the original object (for mutable objects) or a new object (for immutable objects). Method chaining makes the code more readable and concise and is especially beneficial when performing multiple transformations or operations on an object.
What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

The == operator is the abstract equality operator and will attempt to perform type coercion if the types of the two variables being compared are different. On the other hand, the === operator, known as the strict equality operator, does not perform type coercion, and it will only return true if both the value and the type of the two variables are the same.
How would you handle errors in JavaScript functions??

Errors in JavaScript functions can be handled using try...catch...finally blocks. The try block contains the code that may potentially throw an error, the catch block is executed if an error occurs in the try block, and the finally block is executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of the outcome. Another way to handle errors is by using error-first callbacks, which is a common pattern in Node.js where the first argument of the callback function is reserved for an error object.
Why would we want to throw an error instead of just returning false in the toBe and notToBe methods?

Throwing an error provides more information about what went wrong and allows you to catch the error at a higher level in your code with a try...catch statement. In contrast, simply returning false would only inform you that the values were not equal, without giving any further context or information.
